## DevShare

DevShare is a photo-sharing application for developers who would like to upload and showcase snippets of their code with others.

Make sharing your work with others as simple as with a few clicks on your mobile with DevShare. DevShare seeks to create an ecosystem where developers inspire each other with their projects and receive inspiration from others. DevShare encourages those who use its platform to show appreciation for others’ works and offer constructive feedback to help improve others. DevShare also strives to create an environment not only among developers but also for those looking for developers to recruit, hire, or network with.
