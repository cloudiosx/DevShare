DevShare seeks to create an ecosystem where developers inspire each other with their projects and receive inspiration from others. DevShare encourages those who use its platform to show appreciation for othersâ€™ works and offer constructive feedback to help improve others. DevShare also strives to create an environment not only among developers but also for those looking for developers to recruit, hire, or network with.
